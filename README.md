# Probability-and-Statistics-Project-Work
This repository contains all related project work carried out in relevance to Probability and Statistics. This includes code used to develop a Monte Carlo Algorithm used to simulate the behavior of random variables. 
The repository also includes code that implements a Maximum-A-Posteriori decision with a multivariate Gaussian distribution in order to separate the foreground from the background of a 500 x 375 pixel picture.
Also included is code that encodes as well as reconstructs an audio signal using Linear Prediction Code.
